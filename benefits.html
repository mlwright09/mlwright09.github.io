<dl>
<dt>What is Pharmatil?</dt>
<dd>Pharmatil is an online and mobile application for patients, medical personnel, and pharmacies.<br>
<br>
</dd>
<dt>Why would a patient want Pharmatil?</dt>
<dd>Having a Pharmatil shows you: your medical history, know what side effects your medication may have, and allows recording any side effects you experience. Pharmatil shows you: your insurance information, provider information, and bill payments. You will recive a notification when your prescription is ready for pick up. The best part is you only have to fill out your medical forms once!</dd>
<br>
<dt>Why would a Doctor join?</dt>
<dd>A doctor would be have an accurate medical history of their patients. Get an immediate notification if a prescription they have given is not covered by the patients insurance and a list of similar medications they do cover. They would also receive a notification if their patient has recorded having any side effects from medication. Any prescriptions you write will be sent to the pharmacy electronically.
</dd>
<br>
<dt>How does Pharmatil benefit pharmacies? </dt>
<dd>Pharmacies would not have to waste time verifying a prescription coverage. They can have access to their patient's medical records, allowing them to give the patient a medicine that will help them instead of hurt them. Your pharmacists will be less stressed about patients waiting for the prescription in their store. They will be able to start on a prescription before the patient makes it to the pharmacy and be able to spend more time telling the patient about their medication. </dd>
